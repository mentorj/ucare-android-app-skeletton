:description: documentation for the Ucare skeletton application
:keywords: Android, architecture
:imagesdir: ./img

This document aims to provide basic guidelines to use & improve the Android application

== Goals
The application aims to be a skeletton, it does not work, it is not finished but:

* show main concepts & entities required
* import most of the application required libraries
** JTranforms for FFT computations
** EventBus for communication between components
** Eclipse MQTT client for MQTT message passing
** Room for data persistence
* setup some entities in the  correct way:
** proper configuration for kapt Annotation Processor
** gather all pieces required for object persistence to database with Room
** configure EventBus the right way (with indices)
** services communication through EventBus messages with Event classes

== Missing parts
This is only a skeletton so :

* code is not tested (no unit testing)
* code has not even been launched
* most classes are  merely stubs and should be enchanced and fixed
